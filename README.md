As an independent machine learning researcher and programmer, I am dedicated to advancing the field through innovative experiments and cutting-edge technology. With a background in computer science and a passion for artificial intelligence, I am constantly seeking new ways to improve and expand upon existing methods.

However, I am currently limited by the tools and resources available to me. In order to continue my work and make important contributions to the field of machine learning, I am in need of support to purchase a real computer. Any donations towards this cause will be greatly appreciated and will help me to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with machine learning. Thank you for your support!
