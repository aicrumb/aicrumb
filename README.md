You meed to be forward with me, I have autism and can't understand most thongs well. I'm also selective mute (relating to the autism).
My preferred method of communication is Twitter DMs

[blog](https://medium.com/@crumbly) (not really updated frequently, but "big" projects here)

[twitter](https://twitter.com/aicrumb) (most up to date on what i'm currently working on)

[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/crumb) (hosting models of which, there are probably none of note right now)
