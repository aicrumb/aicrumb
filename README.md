# Crumb's AI Projects

Hi there! I am an experienced independent machine learning researcher and programmer, with a passion for advancing the field through innovative experiments and cutting-edge technology. I don't use Github often, you can follow my work on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aicrumb, or check out my contributions on Hugging Face at https://hf.co/crumb. I use she/xe pronouns. Apologies for the mess.

Here are a few of the projects I've been working on lately:
### Doohickey

- Text2img notebook built on top of Stable Diffusion
- https://hf.co/doohickey

### One-Person RLHF (+PPO with aesthetic models)

- Tuned a prompt-generating BLOOM model for aesthetic Stable Diffusion results
- https://twitter.com/aicrumb/status/1598248104981319681

### Fake-GPT-J

- Trained GPT on algorithmically generated languages for transfer learning studies
- Small-scale project, but would love to scale it up
- https://hf.co/crumb/fake-gpt-j-17m

### Quick Inversions for Stable Diffusion

### Adversarial Attacks towards AI-Art-Adjacent tools

- Investigated the effectiveness of certain adversarial attacks on AI tools
- https://twitter.com/aicrumb/status/1580440734192148481 (explainer thread)
- https://colab.research.google.com/github/aicrumb/notebook-hosting/blob/main/Adversarial_Attacks_to_AI_Art_Tools.ipynb (messy code)

As an independent machine learning researcher and programmer, I am dedicated to advancing the field through innovative experiments and cutting-edge technology. With a background in computer science and a passion for artificial intelligence, I am constantly seeking new ways to improve and expand upon existing methods.

However, I am currently limited by the tools and resources available to me. In order to continue my work and make important contributions to the field of machine learning, I am in need of support to purchase a real computer. Any donations towards this cause will be greatly appreciated and will help me to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with machine learning. Thank you for your support!
